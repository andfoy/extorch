  A torch.device is an object representing the device on which a torch.Tensor
  is or will be allocated. The torch.device contains a device type ('cpu' or 'cuda')
  and optional device ordinal for the device type. If the device ordinal is not
  present, this object will always represent the current device for the device type,
  even after ``torch.cuda.set_device()`` is called; e.g., a torch.Tensor constructed
  with device 'cuda' is equivalent to 'cuda:X' where X is the result of
  ``torch.cuda.current_device()``.

  * A torch.Tensorâ€™s device can be accessed via the Tensor.device property.

  * A torch.device can be constructed via a string or via a string and device ordinal
